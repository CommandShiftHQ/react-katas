## React Katas

Here are some React Kata's that will help you get to grip with React Hooks in an application. If you get stuck at any point, please use the Slack channel to ask questions.

Complete in the following order by opening the following components:

1. State Management (StateManagement.js)

In here you are expected to make use of the useState hook. Add logic to the handleClick method so that when a user clicks on the button, the state increments by 1 each time. Also be sure to display this to user so they are aware the incrementation is happening when the button is clicked.

2. Props Management (PropsManagement.js)

Pass your state in the components nested inside of the PropsManagement component. Once you have done that, ensure the app runs as intended and your name is displayed and your (very short) family tree is updated.


3. Complex State (ComplexStateManagement.js)

For this one, display all the names listed in an unordered list on the page.

4. Complex Props (ComplexPropsManagement.js)

Here you will pass all your bands into the Bands component and all your albums into your Album component. Once you have done that you will display them as a list on the page for users to see what bands and albums they have in their database.


## Extra
If you're feeling adventurous you should have a go at solving the extra content also. P.s. you really should, live a little!

5. Use Context (CreateContext.js & UseContext.js)
